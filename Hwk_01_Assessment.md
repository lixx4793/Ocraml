### Assessment for Homework 01

Below are the automated scores for Homework 1.  If you feel that our scripts are incorrectly assessing your work then please email ``csci2041@cs.umn.edu`` and explain the problem.  If your code is right you will get credit for it - just maybe not right away.

**Contains fix for rounding error!** Please email ``csci2041@cs.umn.edu`` if this reduces your score. Please note that this was ran on what was in your directory shortly after the due date on January 30th, 5PM.
